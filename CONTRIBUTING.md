Thanks for your interest!

This repository powers my personal portfolio site. To keep the codebase consistent with my design/deployment workflow, I’m **not accepting external pull requests** at this time.

## Reporting issues
If you’ve found a bug or have a suggestion:
- Please open an issue with repro steps (or a short screen recording).
- Include your device/browser info if it’s a UI issue.

## Security
If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please avoid posting details publicly. Open an issue with minimal detail and I’ll follow up.
