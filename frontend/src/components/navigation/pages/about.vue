          I’m a senior UX/UI designer and full-stack developer with over a
          decade of experience building thoughtful digital products. I work at
          the intersection of design and engineering, focusing on clarity,
          usability, and systems that scale. My goal is simple: create
          experiences that feel intuitive and intentional.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-font-primary/75">
          My process starts with understanding the problem and shaping content
          and user flows before moving into design and development. I favor
          clean interfaces, strong structure, and maintainable solutions. From
          UX strategy and design systems to modern front-end frameworks and
          CMS-driven platforms, I’m comfortable working across the full stack.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-font-primary/75">
          Today, I build flexible, high-performing web experiences while
          collaborating closely with teams and helping projects move from idea
          to launch. I enjoy solving complex problems, refining the details, and
          creating work that holds up long after release.
